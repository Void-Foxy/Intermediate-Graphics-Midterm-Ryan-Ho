The completion of the "realistic textures" and background change were completed

For the Ship, a mix of many shaders were used for each component. A base of using StandardPBR, and PhongSpecular shaders were used to compose a base of the model. This was done to give it a solid look with reflections and color. A modified version of the Rim Lighting with the transparencey was used to create the weapons. This gave the rim of the tip the blue light that is seen while also letting the material of the arm trhough the center. To highlight all the materials and shaders used, the light moves around the ship in a clockwise direction. As for the change of the environment, modifications were done to the normal map shader. The shader has a new color imported and multiplied by the base texture. This allowed for the original texture with normal mapping to change color without changing material or normal maps. 

Any and all asset are made by me with the exception of the ones listed below

Grass Texture and normal map was taken from https://3dtextures.me/2020/07/28/stylized-grass-002/
